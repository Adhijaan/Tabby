## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Highlights

### Core Technologies

- **Chrome Extension APIs** (Manifest V3, Service Workers, Content Scripts)
- **OpenRouter API Integration** (AI completions)
- **Modern JavaScript** (ES6+, Async/Await)
- **DOM Manipulation** (Dynamic element positioning and scrolling)
- **Debounced API Calls** (Optimized performance)
- **API Key Managment** (Through `chrome.storage`)

### Key Components

- **Content Script** (content.js): Detects textareas, handles user input, overlays ghost text suggestions.
- **Service Worker** (background.js): Manages API communication and message passing.
- **Options Page** (hello.html + options.js): Allows users to configure API keys and settings.

## üìö Development Journey

### Challenges Faced

- **Alignment** - I struggled getting the ghost text overlay to align with the text element.
- **Documenation** - I skipped reading chrome documentation initally relying on LLMs to give me information as needed. I learned this is not an effective approach and it is worth first breaking down what I might need for a project and then reading the relevant documentaion

### Future Improvements

- **Mid text suggestions** - I'd like to allow suggestions while the use is in the middle of their text instead of only at the end.
- **LLM Model Selection** - I want to allow a user to choose different models in case they hit rate limits or want a specific model for a task
